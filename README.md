##  Setup 
### For Linux users
1. Create environment:

    `conda list --explicit > spec-file.txt`
    
    `conda create --name projectenv --file spec-file.txt`

2. Install package: go to `*/anaconda3/envs/projectenv/lib/python3.<version_num>/site-packages` in your file system and paste the .so file and the folder that you can find in `package` folder. 
    For instance:
    
    `cd /opt/anaconda3/envs/projectenv/lib/python3.8/site-packages`
    
    `cp path/package/db_lob.cpython-39-x86_64-linux-gnu.so .`
    
    `cp -r path/package/db_lob-0.0.5.dist-info .`
    
3. Work in the new enviroment:
    `conda activate projectenv`
    
4. Create kernel:
    `conda install ipykernel`
    `ipython kernel install --user --name=projectenv`

### For OSX users
Setup a VM with conda and install the package.

Or, for us to work:

* Download a RDP client (from app store [Microsoft Remote Desktop](https://apps.apple.com/it/app/microsoft-remote-desktop/id1295203466?mt=12))
* PC name: 20.108.243.79:3389
* Work in the env with the package intalled: `conda activate project`
* in Jupyter lab use project kernel to run jupyter notebooks, while xsor env works only running python scripts

## Probability of Informed Trading

The probability of informed trading (PIN) measures how likely it is that some players engage in informed trading, while the rest simply trade randomly.
Such quantity depends on the following parameters:
* $\alpha$: probability that new information will arrive within the timeframe of the analysis;
*  $\delta$: probability ùõø that the news will be bad;
* $\mu$: rate of arrival of informed traders;
* $\epsilon$: rate of arrival of uninformed traders.

Once these parameters are known it can be computed by applying a maximum likelihood approach:
